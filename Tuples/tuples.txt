Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Tuples are one of 4 built-in data types in python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are:
 list, Set, and dictonary, all are diffenrent quality and different usage


 A Tuples are written with round bracket
 A Tuples are collection which is ordred and unchangable

 Tuples items are ordered, unchangable, and allows duplicate values.

 Tuples items are indexed, the first items has index [0], and second item has index [1] etc.

 When we say the tuples are ordered, it means items has defined order, and that order will not change.

 Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that cannot change, add or removed after  tuples are created.

 Tuples allows duplicate values

 To determine length of tuple, use len() function

 Tuples can be of diffent type depending upon values stored
 tuples1 = ("apple","banane")
 tuples2 = (1,2,3,,4,5)
 tuples3 = (True, False, True)

 To update tuples first convert it into list them revconvert into tuple
