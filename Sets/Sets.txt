Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Set is one of 4-built in data type in python used to store collections of data, 
the other 3 are List, Tuple and dictonary, all with different qualities and usage.

A set is a collection which is ordered, unchangable, and unindexed.

Set items are unchangable, but you can remove items and add new items.

Sets are unordered , so you cannot be sure in which order items will appear.

Set items are unordered, unchangable and do not allow duplicate values.

Set items are unchangable, meaning that we cannot change the item after the set
has been created.

True and 1 is considered as same value
False and 0 is considered as same value


List : It is collection which is ordered and changable. Allows duplicate members.
Tuples: It is collection which is ordered and unchangable . Allows duplicate members.
Set: It is a collection which is unordered, unchangable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
Dictonary: It is a collection which is ordered**, and changeable. No duplicate members.
